# Terrible web browser game
## Why?
* To make fun of my friend who's doing great things with the peace corps.
* Speed write this in a weekend (won't lie, it was a 3 day weekend).
* Learn very, very basic browser gaming concepts.

## Things you can do

Status | Control Character | Reflect On Life Choices | Leave A Message
--- | --- | --- | ---
`Player` | <li>[x]</li> | <li>[x]</li> | <li>[x]</li>
`Spectator` | <li>[ ]</li> | <li>[ ]</li> | <li>[x]</li>

## Things you can't do

* You can't really do anything other than move the character if you're in control and reflect on life choices. This is intentional.
